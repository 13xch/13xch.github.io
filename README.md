## About Me 

My name is Connor, and I am a current cybersecurity student at a small private school in Indiana, passionate about pentesting, ethical hacking, network security, and all things relate to cybersecurity. I am looking to learn more and share my work with others, so I have set up this page to document my learning and record my progress!

You can find more about me or explore this project through the links below.
